      <h1>Travel Experience</h1>
      <p>I have been to Cuba 2 times before with my family. The first time was in 2020, and the second time was in 2024. Cuba is known for its beautiful, vibrant beaches making it a very popular destination for vacation. We chose to go to Cuba during the summer, so it was very hot. We visited different resorts each time, and it was a memorable experience.</p>
